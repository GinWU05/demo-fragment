Trusting the HTTPS development certificate was requested. If the certificate is not already trusted we will run the following command:
'sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain <<certificate>>'
This command might prompt you for your password to install the certificate on the system keychain.
Password:
A valid HTTPS certificate is already present.

dotnet watch run

The ASP.NET Core developer certificate is in an invalid state. To fix this issue, run 'dotnet dev-certs https --clean' and 'dotnet dev-certs https' to remove all existing ASP.NET Core development certificates and create a new untrusted developer certificate. On macOS or Windows, use 'dotnet dev-certs https --trust' to trust the new certificate.
